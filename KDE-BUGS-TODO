Things I've noticed:

bug: edit comment on a disabled 3rd party repo and it becomes enabled
bug: gtk frontend has two on_treeview_sources_cursor_changed, not sure which is correct, probably second
bug: newly selected mirrors are not put into combo box
bug: add_key always returns true
  we should use gpg --dry-run before too
bug: gtk frontend UI strings don't translate
issue: may want to add a gtk crash handler

TODO:

server combobox changed
i18n
adept integration
crash dialogue
drag and drop for sources list
cdrom listview needs implementing (both frontends)
insert CD support, somehow
various functions in the mirror dialogue: custom mirrors, edit, find fastest etc.  DialogMirror.py should be abstracted for frontend independence

WON'T FIX:
issue: no way to set source code back to inconsistent state, so checkbox 
       needs tristate turned off
rationale: would add to much complexity. the inconsistent state should only
           be visible if the user made some custom modifications. so we would
	   have to keep a history of all changes and take mulitiple 
	   inconsistent states into account. finally there is a global
	   revert button.
FIXED:
packaging

bug: self.get_source_code_state() never returns false, only None (fixed in backend and KDE)

bug: popcon state doesn't get saved (or loaded)

bug: checkbutton source code sometimes can't be ticked

bug: rm /etc/apt/sources.list; start up; all Update tickboxes disabled and never become enabled
bug: after adding repo, doesn't show change
bug: editing 3rd party archives doesn't show changes
bug: gtk checkboxes are never marked as inconsistent
bug: click 3rd party enable/disable twice and it doesn't get back to original state
bug: on_button_revert_clicked doesn't revert the UI
   Was a transistion error. The current solution is not nice, but works:
   reload the isv_sources and show_distro after each change :/
   It would be nice to store the meta data anywhere else, so that
   we won't have to recreate the ui elements.

bug?  untick "main" and main doesn't go away
  was a problem with empty sources.list files. python-apt now handles this 
  corner case correctly


ANSWERED:
question: where do update radio buttons get disabled/enabled at program start?
answer: SoftwareProperties.get_update_automation_level() and 
        SoftwarePropertiesGtk.show_auto_update_level()

issue: DialogAddSourcesList obsolete?
answer: No, it is used to open sources.list files (by drag and drop or
        double click)
