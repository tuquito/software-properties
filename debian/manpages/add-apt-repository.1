.SH DESCRIPTION
.B add-apt-repository
is a script which adds an external APT repository to either
/etc/apt/sources.list or a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.

Currently the only option supported by add-apt-repository is as follows:

.B -h,--help
Show help message and exit

.SH REPOSITORY STRING
\fIREPOSITORY\fR can be either a line that can be added directly to
sources.list(5), or in the form ppa:<user>/<ppa-name> for adding Personal
Package Archives.

In the first form, \fIREPOSITORY\fR will just be appended to
/etc/apt/sources.list.

In the second form, ppa:<user>/<ppa-name> will be expanded to the full deb line
of the PPA and added into a new file in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
directory.
The GPG public key of the newly added PPA will also be downloaded and
added to apt's keyring.
